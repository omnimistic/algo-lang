so what is AlgoLang? i was being taught to write algorithms in class and i was like "hmmm, you know what? waht if i make this into a programming language? will be kinda cool ngl" so i created this repo made a simple file lpading system and fogot about it. a week or so later i suddently remember about this and then pulled an all nighter finishig it. it works pretty well and even follows BODMAS rule for arithmatic stuff. for that i had to learn about something called recursive descent parser which is used in low level compilers and stuff so that was pretty cool. anyways here are the currently available keywords:

START - defines where the program starts
END - defines where the program stops executing
DECLARE - used to declare variables
GOTO - start interpreting from a specific line
IF - if conditional
OUTPUT - output variable, integer, strings
INPUT - input integers, floats and strings

oh and i also got dynamic variable allocation working which was pretty cool to make. you just type an input and the interpreter decides on its own what kind of input it is and stores it in that variable. pretty cool right?
well thats about it. idk if i am gonna work work on this anymore but yall are free to contribute to it. its a simple project so will be good for new programmers instead of jumping into a complex repo.

actual image of an algorithm i wrote in class:

here is an example code and the output.
